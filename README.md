# configurations
A bunch of Linux configurations for various things.

One line install: 

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speediegamer/configurations/main/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

Requires Git to be installed, if you do not have git install it using your favorite package manager!

Short git: https://tinyurl.com/spdconfig
